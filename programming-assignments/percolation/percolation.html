Write a program to estimate the value of the 
<em>percolation threshold</em>
via Monte Carlo simulation.

<p><b>Percolation.</b>
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic
materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an 
electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below),
under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the
oil to gush through to the surface)?
Scientists have defined an abstract process known as <em>percolation</em>
to model such situations.

<p><b>The model.</b>
We model a percolation system using an <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> grid of <em>sites</em>.
Each site is either <em>open</em> or <em>blocked</em>.
A <em>full</em> site is an open site
that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of
neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites.
We say the system <em>percolates</em> if 
there is a full site in the bottom row.
In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open sites
connected to the top row and that process fills some open
site on the bottom row. (For the 
insulating/metallic materials example, the open sites correspond
to metallic materials, so that a system that percolates 
has a metallic path from top to bottom, with full sites conducting.
For the porous substance example, the open sites 
correspond to empty space through which water might 
flow, so that a system that percolates lets water fill open sites, 
flowing from top to bottom.)

<p><b>The problem.</b>
In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the
following question: if sites are independently set to be open with
probability <em>p</em> (and therefore blocked with
probability 1 &minus; <em>p</em>), what is the probability that the system percolates?
When <em>p</em> equals 0, the system does not percolate; when <em>p</em> equals 1,
the system percolates.
The plots below show the site vacancy probability <em>p</em> versus the percolation
probability for 20-by-20 random grid (left) and 100-by-100 random grid (right).
<p>

<img src = "percolation-threshold100.png" alt = "Percolation threshold for 100-by-100 grid">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</center>

<p>
When <em>N</em> is sufficiently large, there is a <em>threshold</em> value <em>p</em>* such
that when <em>p</em> &lt; <em>p</em>* a random <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> grid 
almost never percolates, and when <em>p</em> &gt; <em>p</em>*,
a random <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> grid almost always percolates.
No mathematical solution for determining the percolation threshold <em>p</em>*
has yet been derived.
Your task is to write a computer program to estimate <em>p</em>*.


<p><b>Percolation data type.</b>
To model a percolation system, create a data type <tt>Percolation</tt> with the following API:

<blockquote>
<pre>
public class Percolation {
   public Percolation(int N)              // create N-by-N grid, with all sites blocked
   public void open(int i, int j)         // open site (row i, column j) if it is not already
   public boolean isOpen(int i, int j)    // is site (row i, column j) open?
   public boolean isFull(int i, int j)    // is site (row i, column j) full?
   public boolean percolates()            // does the system percolate?
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<!-- Use the union-find data structure (as described and implemented
in lecture and provided below) to efficiently implement the <tt>Percolation</tt> data type. -->
By convention, the indices <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>
are integers between 1 and <em>N</em>, where (1, 1) is the upper-left site:
Throw a <tt>java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException</tt>
if either <em>i</em> or <em>j</em> is outside this range.
The constructor should take time proportional to N^2; all methods should
take constant time plus a constant number of calls to the union-find methods 
<tt>union()</tt>, <tt>find()</tt>, <tt>connected()</tt>,
and <tt>count()</tt>.


<p><b>Monte Carlo simulation.</b>
To estimate the percolation threshold, consider the following computational experiment:
<ul>

<p><li> Initialize all sites to be blocked.

<p><li> Repeat the following until the system percolates:

<ul>
<p><li> Choose a site (row <em>i</em>, column <em>j</em>) uniformly at
random among all blocked sites.
<p><li> Open the site (row <em>i</em>, column <em>j</em>).
</ul>

<p><li> The fraction of sites that are opened when the system percolates
provides an estimate of the percolation threshold.
</ul>


<p>
For example, if sites are opened in a 20-by-20 lattice according to the snapshots below,
then our estimate of the percolation threshold is 204/400 = 0.51 because the system
percolates when the 204th site is opened.

<br><center><font size = -1><em>250 open sites</em></font></center>
-->
</tr>
</table>

<p>
By repeating this computation experiment <em>T</em> times and averaging the results,
we obtain a more accurate estimate of the percolation threshold.
Let <em>x<sub>t</sub></em> be the fraction of open sites in computational experiment <em>t</em>.
The sample mean &mu; provides an estimate of the percolation threshold;
the sample standard deviation &sigma; measures the sharpness of the threshold.

</blockquote>

Assuming <em>T</em> is sufficiently large (say, at least 30), the following
provides a 95% confidence interval for the percolation threshold:

<p>
<blockquote>
<img src = "percolation-confidence.png" alt = "95% confidence interval for percolation threshold">
</blockquote>

<p>
To perform a series of computational experiments, create a data type <tt>PercolationStats</tt>
with the following API.

<blockquote>
<pre>
public class PercolationStats {
   public PercolationStats(int N, int T)    // perform T independent computational experiments on an N-by-N grid
   public double mean()                     // sample mean of percolation threshold
   public double stddev()                   // sample standard deviation of percolation threshold
   public double confidenceLo()             // returns lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
   public double confidenceHi()             // returns upper bound of the 95% confidence interval
   public static void main(String[] args)   // test client, described below
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The constructor should throw a <tt>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</tt> if either <em>N</em> &le; 0 or
<em>T</em> &le; 0.
<p>
Also, include a <tt>main()</tt> method
that takes two <em>command-line arguments</em>
<em>N</em> and <em>T</em>, performs <em>T</em> independent
computational experiments (discussed above) on an <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> grid,
and prints out the mean, standard deviation, and the 
<em>95% confidence interval</em> for the percolation threshold.
Use <em>standard random</em> from our standard libraries to generate random numbers;
use <em>standard statistics</em> to compute the sample mean and standard deviation.

<blockquote>
<pre>
